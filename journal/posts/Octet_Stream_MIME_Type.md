## Octet Stream MIME Type

A MIME attachment with the content type “application/octet-stream” is a binary file. Typically, it will be an application or a document that must be opened in an application, such as a spreadsheet or word processor. No matter what kind of file it is, an application/octet-stream attachment is rarely viewable in an email or web client.
